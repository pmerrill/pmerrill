# Hi, I'm Peter Merrill 👋
### Senior Full-Stack Engineer | Product-Minded | Healthcare Systems

I'm a Minnesota-based engineer building reliable software for healthcare systems. 14+ years of experience across healthcare, sports, and consumer tech.

Currently at [RxAnte](https://rxante.com), where I focus on pharmacy workflow systems for patients with complex medical needs. Over the past 4.5 years, I've re-architected integrations to support 6x patient growth and built clinical decision tools that measurably improved patient outcomes.

I focus on good API design, thoughtful architecture, and replacing manual processes with reliable, well-tested systems.

### 🔨 Currently working on

**Production:**
* **[Chomp Foods API](https://chompthis.com/api)** - SaaS nutrition database API serving **900K+ foods** (28M+ records) to health & fitness apps. Engineered <100ms response times using LEMP stack, Redis caching, and optimized MySQL queries. [Architecture deep-dive →](https://github.com/pmerrill/Chomp-Foods-API-Architecture)

**Internal Tooling:**
* **[Dev Environment CLI](https://github.com/pmerrill/Dev-Environment-CLI)** - Modular CLI framework for standardizing team development workflows (Node.js, oclif, Docker orchestration). Inspired by internal tooling built at RxAnte to eliminate "works on my machine" issues.
* **[Docker Mongo Schema Tester](https://github.com/pmerrill/Docker-Mongo-Schema-Tester)** - A lightweight framework for validating complex MongoDB JSON schemas using ephemeral Docker containers. Learning project inspired by integration testing work at RxAnte.

**Experiments & Learning:**
* **Missing Letters** - Word completion game with increasing difficulty and strategic letter selection (React, game state management)
* **Plenum** - Proximity-based anonymous chat leveraging geolocation APIs and real-time Firebase architecture
* **Poker Trainer** - Learning app for beginners with hand-ranking games, timed challenges, puzzle scenarios, and 50+ lessons with XP progression (React)
