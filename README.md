# Hi, I'm Peter Merrill. 👋
### Senior Full-Stack Engineer | Product-Minded | HealthTech

I'm a Minnesota-based engineer passionate about solving hard problems in healthcare systems. With 14+ years of experience transforming legacy codebases into scalable, **Event-Driven Systems**, I specialize in **healthcare interoperability**, performance optimization, and building developer tooling that eliminates friction.

Currently at [RxAnte](https://rxante.com), scaling pharmacy workflow systems for 12k+ patients with complex medical histories requiring high-touch care.

### 🔨 Currently working on

**Production:**
* **[Chomp Foods API](https://chompthis.com/api)** - SaaS food data API serving **900K+ foods** across **28M+ records** to health & fitness apps. Engineered <100ms response times using LEMP stack, Redis caching, and optimized MySQL queries. [Architecture deep-dive →](https://github.com/pmerrill/Chomp-Foods-API-Architecture)

**Internal Tooling:**
* **[Dev Environment CLI](https://github.com/pmerrill/Dev-Environment-CLI)** - Modular CLI framework for standardizing team development workflows (Node.js, oclif, Docker orchestration). Inspired by internal tooling built at RxAnte to eliminate "works on my machine" issues.

**Experiments & Learning:**
* **Missing Letters** - Word completion game with increasing word length and strategic letter selection between rounds (React, game state management)
* **Plenum** - Proximity-based anonymous chat leveraging geolocation APIs and real-time Firebase architecture
* **Poker Trainer** - Learning app for beginners with hand-ranking games, timed challenges, puzzle scenarios, and 50+ lessons with XP progression (React)
