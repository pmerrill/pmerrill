# Hi, I'm Peter Merrill. 👋

**Senior Full-Stack Engineer & Architect**

I am a product-minded engineer with 14+ years of experience specializing in **healthcare** and **consumer tech**. I focus on modernizing legacy systems, solving scalability bottlenecks, and building tools that make developer teams faster and happier.

Currently, I'm a Senior Engineer at [RxAnte](https://www.rxante.com/), building event-driven systems to support patient care at scale.

### 🛠 What I Do best
* **System Modernization:** I turn fragile, polling-based integrations into robust **Event-Driven Architectures** (Salesforce CDC).
* **Performance at Scale:** Founder of [Chomp Foods](https://chompthis.com), where I optimized API latency from **2s to <100ms** for 900k+ users.
* **Developer Experience:** I believe the best way to move fast is to have great tooling. I build CLI tools and Docker-based testing frameworks to standardize environments.
